# Lenses & Visibility Control

This document defines **lenses** as grammar-level instruments for controlling *visibility* without altering underlying structure. It clarifies how lenses operate, how they differ from operators and representations, and how misuse of lenses produces predictable failure modes.

Lenses do **not** act on reality. They determine **what distinctions are legible**.

---

## 0. Orientation

- A lens changes *what is seen*, not *what is real*.
- Lenses are admissible only if removing them leaves underlying structure unchanged.
- Visibility control is upstream of evaluation, optimization, and explanation.

This document is a **discipline guide**, not an epistemology.

## 1. Visibility as a Structural Property

### Visibility

Visibility refers to which distinctions are resolvable under a given configuration of constraints, lenses, and bookkeeping.

- Visibility is not attention or perception.
- Visibility is not truth.
- Visibility is a property of structural alignment.

Changes in visibility do not imply changes in structure.

## 2. What a Lens Is

### Definition

A **lens** is a grammar-level construct that:
- selects distinctions,
- suppresses others,
- and stabilizes a view,

**without performing transformation, projection, or evaluation**.

A lens may *contain* representations or mappings, but only as passive views.

---

## 3. What a Lens Is Not

A lens is **not**:
- an operator (it does not act),
- a measurement (it does not interact),
- a projection (it does not discard),
- an evaluation (it does not narrow),
- a model (it does not claim adequacy),
- an authority (it does not decide).

Confusing any of these with a lens is a grammar-level error.

---

## 4. Types of Lenses (Non-Exhaustive)

These categories are descriptive, not taxonomic.

### Structural Lenses

- Make roles and relations visible
- Common in grammar construction

### Representational Lenses

- Emphasize specific encodings or descriptors
- Often mistaken for reality

### Mathematical / Formal Lenses

- Highlight invariants or symmetries
- Risk reification under pressure

### Diagnostic Lenses

- Surface failure modes or instability
- Often invisible when functioning correctly

---

## 5. Lens Hardening and Failure Modes

### Lens Hardening

Lens hardening occurs when a lens:
- becomes implicit,
- stops being adjustable,
- and is treated as structure itself.

### Resulting Failures

- Representational literalism
- Bookkeeping-to-mechanism promotion
- Boundary misattribution

---

## 6. Lenses and Inquiry

- Inquiry may involve *changing lenses* without evaluation
- Lens change is not progress; it is reorientation
- Multiple lenses may coexist without contradiction

Premature fixation of a lens accelerates collapse.

---

## 7. Lenses and Collapse

- Collapse often coincides with unacknowledged lens hardening
- When alternatives disappear, check whether visibility—not structure—was reduced

Branching frequently occurs through lens adjustment rather than new structure.

---

## 8. Common Misattributions

- Treating a lens as a mechanism
- Treating visibility as causation
- Treating invariance under a lens as universality

Each misattribution converts a passive instrument into an active claim.

## Status

Field Guide Draft v0.1

Lenses should remain adjustable. Their failure is to become invisible.
