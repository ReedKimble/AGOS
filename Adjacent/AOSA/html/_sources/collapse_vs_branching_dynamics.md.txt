# Collapse vs Branching Dynamics

This document examines **collapse** and **branching** as opposing but non-symmetric structural dynamics governing how possibility space changes under pressure.

Neither collapse nor branching is a success condition. Both are **consequences of constraint interaction**, visibility, and declaration.

---

## 0. Orientation

- Collapse and branching are **cross-level dynamics**, not domain mechanisms.
- Both describe changes in *admissible alternatives*, not truth or correctness.
- The critical distinction is **declaration**: what loss or expansion is made explicit.

---

## 1. Possibility Space and Admissibility

### Possibility Space

Possibility space refers to the set of admissible alternatives available under current constraints.

- It is not hypothetical imagination.
- It is not epistemic uncertainty.
- It is structurally defined by constraints, lenses, and declarations.

Changes to possibility space are the only admissible way to describe collapse or branching.

---

## 2. Collapse (Undeclared Narrowing)

### Description

**Collapse** is the **undeclared reduction of admissible alternatives**.

Collapse always involves loss, but that loss is:
- not explicitly acknowledged,
- not scoped,
- and not reversible within the same regime.

### Structural Conditions for Collapse

Collapse typically occurs when:
- pressure exceeds stability,
- tolerance is exceeded,
- and evaluation is invoked implicitly rather than declared.

### Diagnostic Signals

- Sudden disappearance of alternatives
- Retrospective justification
- Claims of inevitability or necessity

### Structural Consequence

Collapse reduces possibility space **without leaving a record** of what was lost.

---

## 3. Branching (Declared Expansion)

### Description

**Branching** is an **increase in admissible alternatives** made explicit under constraint.

Branching does not invent structure; it reveals previously implicit alternatives or creates new distinctions via differentiation.

### Structural Conditions for Branching

Branching typically occurs when:
- inquiry is sustained without premature evaluation,
- lenses are adjusted rather than fixed,
- and constraints are re-expressed without collapse.

### Diagnostic Signals

- Explicit articulation of alternatives
- Preservation of multiple paths
- Resistance to premature narrowing

### Structural Consequence

Branching widens possibility space while maintaining coherence.

---

## 4. Declared vs Undeclared Change

### Declared Narrowing

- Occurs via explicit projection or evaluation
- Loss is acknowledged and scoped
- Enables reversibility through re-entry

### Undeclared Narrowing (Collapse)

- Occurs implicitly under pressure
- Loss is hidden or misattributed
- Irreversible within the same regime

### Declared Expansion (Branching)

- Alternatives are made explicit
- No loss is hidden
- Structural load increases but coherence is preserved

---

## 5. Collapse Is Not the Opposite of Branching

Although often treated as opposites, collapse and branching are **not symmetric**.

- Collapse is loss without declaration.
- Branching is expansion with declaration.

The true opposite of collapse is **declared narrowing**, not branching.

Branching and collapse may even co-occur at different levels.

---

## 6. Relationship to Decoherence and Instability

- **Instability** describes a rate mismatch between pressure and stability.
- **Decoherence** describes loss of coordination without elimination.

Instability increases the *risk* of collapse but does not cause it.

Collapse occurs only when narrowing happens without declaration.

Branching can occur during instability if inquiry remains open and loss is resisted.

---

## 7. Visibility and Retrospective Illusion

Collapse is often invisible to practitioners because:
- lenses harden under pressure,
- records replace memory of alternatives,
- and justification occurs after loss.

Branching remains visible because:
- alternatives are tracked,
- loss is not hidden,
- and evaluation is deferred.

---

## 8. Common Misattributions

- Treating collapse as convergence
- Treating branching as indecision
- Treating inevitability as proof
- Treating loss as optimization

Each misattribution masks a structural dynamic.

---

## 9. Implications for Inquiry and Domains

- Healthy inquiry preserves branching until evaluation is declared.
- Domains incentivize collapse due to survival pressure.
- Cross-domain work is especially collapse-prone without explicit loss declaration.

Field Guide Draft v0.1

Collapse and branching dynamics are expected to sharpen under use, not refinement.
