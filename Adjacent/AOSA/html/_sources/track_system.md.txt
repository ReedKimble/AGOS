# Internal Track System

Purpose: make structure visible without prose explanation and allow bookkeeping activities.

---

## 0. Purpose of the Track System

The track system exists to make *structure visible without prose explanation*.

Tracks are **not annotations**, **not citations**, and **not metadata**. They are *structural declarations* that constrain how an entry may be used, related, or extended.

An entry is not complete when it is defined; it is complete when its **tracks are coherent**.

---

## 1. Design Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

The track system MUST:

- Be ASCII-only and typable
- Be finite and minimal (small, closed set)
- Avoid hierarchy and authority leakage
- Encode failure as first-class
- Support partial and incomplete entries
- Be readable by humans and parsable by tools

The track system MUST NOT:

- Imply truth, correctness, or endorsement
- Encode ontology or metaphysical commitment
- Act as a taxonomy or dependency tree
- Replace judgment or reasoning

---

## 2. Track Syntax (Canonical)

Each track is written as:

```
@TRACK_NAME: value[, value, ...]
```

Rules:

- Track names are uppercase ASCII
- Values are symbolic identifiers, not prose
- Absence of a track is meaningful
- Tracks may contradict across entries; contradictions are *diagnostic*

---

## 3. Core Track Set (v0.1)

This set is intentionally small. New tracks are forbidden unless they cannot be expressed by composition of existing tracks.

---

### 3.1 @LEVEL

Declares the *highest admissible structural regime* in which the entry may operate.

Allowed values:

- PROTO
- GRAMMAR
- DOMAIN
- ECOLOGY

Rules:

- An entry may not be used above its declared level
- Using an entry below its level is permitted but lossy

---

### 3.2 @ROLE

Declares the kind of structural work the entry performs.

Common values:

- CONSTRAINT
- RELATION
- OPERATOR
- DESCRIPTOR
- RECORD
- DIAGNOSTIC

Rules:

- ROLE is descriptive, not prescriptive
- Multiple roles are allowed if tension is intentional

---

### 3.3 @CONSTRAINS

Declares what this entry forbids or narrows.

Values:

- References to other entries

Interpretation:

- Directional
- Non-symmetric
- Absence implies permissive structure

---

### 3.4 @REQUIRES

Declares prerequisites for admissible use.

Values:

- Other entries
- Structural conditions (e.g., VISIBILITY, CONTEXT)

Interpretation:

- If requirements are unmet, use becomes undefined rather than false

---

### 3.5 @FAILS\_AS

Declares the failure modes this entry tends toward when overloaded or misplaced.

Values:

- Named failure modes

Interpretation:

- Predictive, not accusatory
- Central to diagnosis

---

### 3.6 @OPPOSES

Declares structural incompatibility.

Values:

- Other entries

Interpretation:

- Mutual opposition is allowed but must be explicit
- Opposition is not negation

---

### 3.7 @VISIBLE\_WHEN

Declares conditions under which this entry becomes legible.

Values:

- PRESSURE
- INSTABILITY
- FAILURE
- DESCENT

Interpretation:

- Absence implies background structure

---

## 4. Optional Derived Tracks (Use Sparingly)

These tracks are allowed but discouraged.

- @DERIVED\_FROM
- @USED\_IN
- @ALIASES

Rule: If a derived track becomes essential, the core set is insufficient and must be revised.

---

## 5. Example Entry (Illustrative Only)

```
Non-Invention Principle
@LEVEL: PROTO
@ROLE: CONSTRAINT
@CONSTRAINS: PositiveAssertion
@FAILS_AS: PrematureClosure, OntologySmuggling
@VISIBLE_WHEN: DESCENT
```

No prose explanation is required for admissibility.

---

## 6. Failure of the Track System (Expected and Allowed)

The track system is expected to fail when:

- Too many tracks are needed to express a concept
- Tracks begin to encode explanation rather than constraint
- Entries require prose to remain coherent

Such failures are **signals**, not defects.

---

## 7. Relationship to the Atlas

The Atlas is not complete without tracks.

Tracks are how the Atlas:

- Teaches without explaining
- Reveals misuse without accusation
- Preserves coherence under growth

The Atlas must obey its own track constraints.

---

## Status

Draft v0.1 Open to strain, revision, or abandonment.
