# Ingestion and Integration

This document governs how **external structure**—ideas, theories, grammars, domains, artifacts, or practices—is brought into contact with an existing structural system **without collapsing either side**.

Ingestion is not acceptance. Integration is not synthesis.

These rules apply **prior to, independent of, and beyond** the Atlas of Structural Admissibility. The Atlas is one possible host; the constraints here are **structural**, not institutional.

---

## 0. Orientation

- **Ingestion** is contact between structures.
- **Integration** is constrained placement relative to existing constraints.
- Neither implies endorsement, preservation, or coherence.

Structure does not grow by accumulation. It stabilizes by **admissible contact**.

---

## 1. What Ingestion Is

### Description

**Ingestion** is the act of bringing an external structure into *relational visibility*.

An ingested structure may be:
- a theory,
- a paper,
- a formal system,
- a domain grammar,
- a methodological practice,
- or an operational artifact.

Ingestion performs **no evaluation** and induces **no obligation**.

---

## 2. What Ingestion Is Not

Ingestion is **not**:
- validation,
- agreement,
- belief,
- endorsement,
- or adoption.

Treating ingestion as any of the above produces authority leakage.

---

## 3. Integration (Constrained Placement)

### Description

**Integration** is the act of placing an ingested structure relative to:
- known constraints,
- active boundaries,
- visible failure modes,
- and admissible levels of operation.

Integration answers only *placement questions*, such as:
- Where does this structure operate?
- Which boundaries does it repeatedly encounter?
- What failure modes does it induce under pressure?

Integration does **not** attempt to reconcile, optimize, or preserve the internal coherence of the ingested structure.

---

## 4. Structural Loss Is Necessary

Integration necessarily incurs **structural loss**.

Loss may include:
- suppression of internal narratives,
- collapse of domain-specific authority,
- removal of explanatory ambition,
- elimination of incompatible distinctions.

Loss is not a defect. It is the **cost of contact**.

Loss must be **explicitly declared** for integration to remain admissible.

---

## 5. Common Ingestion Failures

### Archive Accretion

- Structures accumulate without placement
- Results in incoherent aggregation

### Synthesis Illusion

- Partial alignment mistaken for unity
- Results in false coherence

### Authority Importation

- External validation standards propagate inward
- Results in structural capture

---

## 6. Integration Without Assimilation

Integration does not imply assimilation.

Instead:
- structures remain distinct,
- only their *interactions* are tracked,
- incompatibilities are preserved rather than resolved.

This allows incompatible grammars to coexist without collapse.

---

## 7. Ingestion as Structural Pressure

Ingested structures apply pressure by:
- challenging existing boundaries,
- exposing missing constraints,
- or revealing previously invisible failure modes.

Ingestion is therefore a **diagnostic operation**, not an additive one.

---

## 8. Integration Heuristics

When integrating any external structure, ask:

- What constraints does it assume?
- What loss does it deny?
- Where does it silently collapse?
- Which lens does it harden?

If these cannot be answered, integration has not occurred.

---

## 9. Relationship to Host Systems

These constraints apply regardless of whether the host system is:
- the Atlas of Structural Admissibility,
- a research program,
- a conceptual framework,
- or an operational practice.

The host system must adapt to ingestion pressure, not absorb it.

## Status

Field Guide Draft v0.2

Integration preserves structure by refusing synthesis.
