# Failure Geography — A Field Guide

This document maps **failure as terrain**, not error. Failure modes are treated as *regions, gradients, and attractors* that structure how grammars degrade under pressure.

Failure is not a mistake to be corrected; it is a **signal of boundary contact, overload, or misplacement**.

## 0. How to Use This Field Guide

- Read failures as *locations*, not accusations.
- Multiple failure modes may coexist; overlap is diagnostic.
- Escalation toward collapse is a trajectory, not an event.
- No failure mode is unique to a domain; domains differ only in how they mask them.

## 1. Scope Inflation Region

### Terrain Description

A broad plateau where concepts appear to apply farther than they are admissible.

### Typical Indicators

- Increasing generality of language
- Loss of explicit constraints
- Phrases like “in general,” “at all levels,” “ultimately”

### Structural Cause

- Grammar exceeds its regime without declaring descent or loss

### Common Misreading

- Interpreted as unification or deep insight

---

## 2. Layer Collapse Basin

### Terrain Description

A steep basin where distinctions between structural levels disappear.

### Typical Indicators

- Grammar-level claims treated as ontological
- Domain mechanisms used to justify grammar

### Structural Cause

- Failure to maintain level separation under pressure

### Common Misreading

- Treated as explanatory elegance or simplicity

---

## 3. Bookkeeping-to-Mechanism Attractor

### Terrain Description

A strong attractor where records, models, or symbols are mistaken for causal agents.

### Typical Indicators

- Data “drives” outcomes
- Algorithms “decide” or “know”

### Structural Cause

- External bookkeeping persistence mistaken for structure

### Common Misreading

- Interpreted as technological or formal power

---

## 4. Approximation Reification Ridge

### Terrain Description

A narrowing ridge where approximations harden into assumed reality.

### Typical Indicators

- Suppression of error terms
- Resistance to model revision

### Structural Cause

- Declared loss forgotten under repeated use

### Common Misreading

- Treated as convergence or proof

---

## 5. Narrative Gravity Well

### Terrain Description

A deep well where explanatory stories overpower structural constraint.

### Typical Indicators

- Anthropomorphic language
- Teleological framing

### Structural Cause

- Human interpretive bias under uncertainty

### Common Misreading

- Treated as understanding or meaning

---

## 6. Premature Closure Cliff

### Terrain Description

A sharp cliff marking forced termination of inquiry.

### Typical Indicators

- Definitive language
- Appeals to final authority

### Structural Cause

- Intolerance for ambiguity or instability

### Common Misreading

- Treated as rigor or decisiveness

---

## 7. Authority Capture Zone

### Terrain Description

A fortified region where structural guidance becomes enforcement.

### Typical Indicators

- Policing of interpretation
- Credential-based dismissal

### Structural Cause

- Boundary between constraint and power erased

### Common Misreading

- Treated as quality control

---

## 8. Collapse Basin

### Terrain Description

A low basin representing undeclared loss of admissible alternatives.

### Typical Indicators

- Irreversible narrowing unnoticed by practitioners
- Vanishing of prior distinctions

### Structural Cause

- Pressure exceeds stability without declaration

### Common Misreading

- Treated as convergence or inevitability

---

## 9. Typical Descent Paths

- Scope Inflation → Layer Collapse → Bookkeeping Attractor
- Approximation Reification → Narrative Gravity → Premature Closure
- Authority Capture → Collapse Basin

These paths are **predictive**, not prescriptive.
