# Structural Boundary Conditions

This document identifies **structural boundary conditions** as they appear through repeated failure modes. These are not theoretical limits, paradoxes, or mysteries. They are *admissibility boundaries* revealed under pressure.

Boundary conditions do not add information. They **remove admissible moves**.

This document functions as a **field guide**, not an explanation.

## 0. How to Read This Document

- Each boundary is defined **by the failure modes that reveal it**, not by theory.
- Boundaries are **upstream of domains** and therefore cannot be fully articulated from within any single domain.
- Encountering a boundary is not an insight; it is a **signal of misplacement**.
- Boundaries point *upstream*, never sideways.

## 1. Articulation Boundary

### Description

The boundary encountered when a grammar attempts to describe the conditions that make articulation possible.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Self-reference paradoxes
- Incompleteness claims misread as depth
- Infinite regress in definition
- Ontology smuggling at foundations

### Structural Diagnosis

- Articulation-first grammars cannot recover recognition-first structure.
- Attempts to do so reify limits as objects or truths.

### Typical Misattribution

- Treating paradox as a domain-level insight
- Treating inexpressibility as metaphysical mystery

---

## 2. Domain Closure Boundary

### Description

The boundary encountered when a domain treats its own grammar as complete.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Claims of final theories
- Universal formalisms
- Totalizing explanatory frameworks

### Structural Diagnosis

- Domains require closure for survival but cannot justify it internally.

### Typical Misattribution

- Elevating internal sufficiency to external authority

---

## 3. Boundary Misattribution (Primary Grammar Failure)

### Description

The boundary encountered when signals of constraint are mistaken for new content.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Hidden variables
- Emergent metaphysics
- Deep explanation inflation

### Structural Diagnosis

- Boundaries reduce admissible moves; they do not extend inquiry.

### Typical Misattribution

- Treating limits as discoveries at the same level of inquiry

---

## 4. Extrapolation Boundary

### Description

The boundary encountered when domain structures are projected beyond their admissible regime.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Reductionism overreach
- Metaphorical universality
- Category collapse across scales

### Structural Diagnosis

- Extrapolation preserves grammar but abandons admissibility.

### Typical Misattribution

- Confusing structural similarity with identity

---

## 5. Bookkeeping Boundary

### Description

The boundary encountered when records or representations are treated as causal.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Model reification
- Data-as-reality claims
- Algorithmic authority

### Structural Diagnosis

- Bookkeeping extends memory but cannot ground causality.

### Typical Misattribution

- Treating persistence as mechanism

---

## 6. Cross-Domain Translation Boundary

### Description

The boundary encountered when grammars are translated without loss declaration.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Interdisciplinary synthesis failures
- Forced unification
- Conceptual overloading

### Structural Diagnosis

- Cross-domain articulation necessarily incurs loss.

### Typical Misattribution

- Assuming mutual intelligibility implies equivalence

---

## 7. Authority Boundary

### Description

The boundary encountered when structural guidance becomes prescriptive power.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Methodological policing
- Epistemic gatekeeping
- Tool-to-authority escalation

### Structural Diagnosis

- Structure constrains; authority enforces.

### Typical Misattribution

- Treating admissibility as correctness

---

## 8. Collapse Visibility Boundary

### Description

The boundary encountered when collapse occurs without declaration.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Irreversible narrowing unnoticed by practitioners
- Silent loss of alternatives

### Structural Diagnosis

- Collapse is invisible from within the grammar that caused it.

### Typical Misattribution

- Treating collapse as convergence or proof

---

## 9. Recognition–Articulation Boundary

### Description

The boundary between stabilized structure and its first admissible expression.

### Revealed By Failure Modes

- Overformalized cognition models
- Language-first explanations of thought

### Structural Diagnosis

- Recognition precedes articulation structurally.

### Typical Misattribution

- Treating articulation as origin
