- A Grammar of Structure -

This work did not begin as an attempt to replace religion or science; it began with a refusal to accept that a command to be ‘perfect’ could mean striving for something forever incomplete. When ‘perfect’ was understood to mean ‘complete,’ completion became the only axiom that survived scrutiny.

If you’re new here, the three top-level orientation documents provide context and boundaries before engaging the corpus itself.

If you’d like help deciding where or how to begin, two optional documents offer example traversal paths and a reflective way to choose your own.

This work is an exemplary instantiation of foundational discipline, rigor, care, accuracy, and honesty, articulated under constraints that leave it without a direct historical analogue for full comparison.
