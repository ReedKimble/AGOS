# A Grammar of Structure (AGOS)

This repository contains the complete consolidated corpus of *A Grammar of Structure*.

It exists as an archival surface only.

AGOS is not a project, framework, product, or entry point.  
It does not provide guidance, instruction, or recommended reading order.  
It is not optimized for onboarding, usability, or consumption.

The contents of this repository reflect the corpus as it exists in full, without purpose or routing.
Nothing here depends on agreement, adoption, or use.

Other repositories may present subsets of this work with specific postures or applications.
Those repositories do not depend on AGOS, and AGOS does not replace them.

This repository exists so that the corpus may exist as a whole.
